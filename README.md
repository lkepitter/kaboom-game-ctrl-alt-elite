# School of Code - Week 12 Research Hackathon

In week 12 for our hackathon we were given the option of researching a new language or engine from a list. We chose the Kaboom.js game engine. 
Following a tutorial we created a simple 2D platformer with placeholder sprites. I then edited this further to add new functionality, such as
a run button, attack button and different camera controls.
